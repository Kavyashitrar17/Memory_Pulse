# 🧠 MemoryPulse – Interactive Pattern Memory Game

MemoryPulse is a browser-based memory training game developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
The game challenges players to repeat an increasing sequence of colors and sounds, testing reaction time, focus, and short-term memory.

Unlike a basic Simon clone, MemoryPulse includes sound feedback, difficulty levels, animations, and persistent high-score storage.
